## Note
The README file is here to document the softwares and Python libraries (version info included) used in this Capstone project.
It is also necessary to include installation info.

## Deliverables

The following files should be included in your submission, and can be packaged as a single zip file for convenience:

* A 9 - 15 page report in PDF addressing the five major project development phases.
* All development code necessary for your solution in a clean, commented format.
* Any required supporting files for your code (.csv datasets, input files, etc.).
* If these files are too large, please instead reference appropriate download links in the README.
* A README documenting the software and libraries used in your project, including any necessary instructions required to execute your code.
