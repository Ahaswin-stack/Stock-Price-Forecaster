    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will want to clearly define the problem that you are trying to solve, including the strategy (outline of tasks) you will use to achieve the desired solution. You should also thoroughly discuss what the intended solution will be for this problem. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",

    "### Data Exploration\n",
    "In this section, you will be expected to analyze the data you are using for the problem. This data can either be in the form of a dataset (or datasets), input data (or input files), or even an environment. The type of data should be thoroughly described and, if possible, have basic statistics and information presented (such as discussion of input features or defining characteristics about the input or environment). Any abnormalities or interesting qualities about the data that may need to be addressed have been identified (such as features that need to be transformed or the possibility of outliers). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a dataset is present for this problem, have you thoroughly discussed certain features about the dataset? Has a data sample been provided to the reader?\n",
    "* If a dataset is present for this problem, are statistics about the dataset calculated and reported? Have any relevant results from this calculation been discussed?\n",
    "* If a dataset is not present for this problem, has discussion been made about the input space or input data for your problem?\n",

    "\n",
    "### Benchmark\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide a clearly defined benchmark result or threshold for comparing across performances obtained by your solution.

    "(approximately 3 - 5 pages)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "In this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?\n",
    "* Based on the Data Exploration section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?\n",
    "* If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process.

    "### Refinement\n",
    "In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation.

    "(approximately 2 - 3 pages)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation and Validation\n",
    "In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?\n",
    "* Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?\n",
    "* Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?\n",
    "* Can results found from the model be trusted?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification\n",
    "In this section, your model’s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?\n",
    "* Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?\n",

    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "(approximately 1 - 2 pages)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Free-Form Visualization\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?\n",
    "* Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?\n",

    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?\n",
    "* Were there any interesting aspects of the project?\n",
    "* Were there any difficult aspects of the project?\n",
    "* Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?\n",
    "* Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?\n",
    "* If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before submitting your report, ask yourself…\n",
    "* Does the project report you’ve written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?\n",
    "* Is each section (particularly Analysis and Methodology) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion? Are there any ambiguous terms or phrases that need clarification?\n",
    "* Would the intended audience of your project be able to understand your analysis, methods, and results?\n",
    "* Have you properly proof-read your project report to assure there are minimal grammatical and spelling mistakes?\n",
    "* Are all the resources used for this project correctly cited and referenced?\n",
    "* Is the code that implements your solution easily readable and properly commented?\n",
    "* Does the code execute without error and produce results similar to those reported?"

    "### Project Overview\n",
    "According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), there are approximately 7.6 millions companion animals end up in US shelters every year. Abandoned or just simply got lost, some of these animals got lucky and got to returned to their owners or adopted, while others not so lucky ones died of sickness or got euthanized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we aim at building a prediction model that can help identify those animals that have less chance of returning home or getting adopted. With the help of a good model the shelters can focus their energy on specific animals that need extra help finding a new home.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project comes from a ongoing Kaggle competition (which ends on July 31, 2016). The data is provided by Austin Animal Center.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build the model using the training dataset `train.csv` and tested on the testing dataset `test.csv`.\n",
